"""PACT-1 core arithmetic — pure numpy.

No torch, no routerl, no SUMO. Every function here is exercised by
``pact1/selftest.py`` without a simulator, which is the whole point: the parts
that can be wrong silently are the parts that must be testable for free.

THE REDUCTION, IN URB TERMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A traveller's excess delay over free flow is, to first order in a link
performance function (BPR: ``t_a = t_a^0 (1 + alpha (v_a/c_a)^beta)``), a sum over
the links of its route of a per-link sensitivity times the peer flow on that link:

    tt_i / fft_i - 1  ~=  beta_0  +  sum_{a in route_i} f'_a * v_a ,
    v_a = sum_{j != i, temporally co-present} 1[a in route_j]

Project the unknown sensitivity field ``f'`` onto ``r`` KNOWN road classes and the
whole thing collapses to

    y_i(t)  =  beta*(t) . psi_i(t) ,     psi_i = [1, x_1, ..., x_r]

with ``x_m`` computable EXACTLY from peers' executed route choices and the network
geometry, and ``beta*`` an (r+1)-vector holding every unknown. That is T2 (the
reduction) instantiated in a domain we did not build: r parameters, independent of
N and of the number of links.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM ANT, STATED PLAINLY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ant's harm is an additive torque you can subtract off, so compensation restores the
stationary game exactly (T3, conjugacy). Base URB has NO such inverse: you cannot
subtract minutes off a congested road. The only response available is to choose a
different route.

So the channel inverse is replaced by a TRUST-WEIGHTED LOGIT SHIFT (``steer_logits``):
the estimator predicts each candidate route's peer-induced delay, and trust decides
how much that prediction biases the choice. T3 does NOT transfer. What does
transfer, unchanged:

  * T2, the reduction                    -> this file's regressor
  * the honest sensor                    -> realized travel time vs own free-flow
  * per-agent RLS with forgetting        -> AgentRLS
  * the inverted trust prior (III.5)     -> trust_from_w, bias 2.2 -> 0.90
  * covariance-gated reliance (III.5)    -> rls_confidence
  * the floor property (III.4)           -> g = 0 gives the untouched policy, EXACTLY
  * T4, the compensation commons (III.8) -> steering onto a route loads it; this is
                                            Wardrop/Braess and is logged as
                                            ``route_switch_frac`` + ``herd_index``

    Decentralized by construction. Agent i never sees another agent's residual —
