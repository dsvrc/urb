## 📊 Calculating Metrics and indicators  

Each experiment outputs set of raw records, which are then processed with the script in this folder for a set of performance indicators which we report and several additional metrics that track the quality of the solution and its impact to the system.

#### Usage

To use the analysis script, you have to provide in the command line the following command:

```bash
python analysis/metrics.py --id <exp_id> --verbose <verbose> --results-folder <results-folder> --skip-collecting <skip-collecting>
```

that will collect the results from the experiment with identifier ```<exp_id>``` and save them in the folder ```<exp_id>/metrics/```. The ```--verbose``` flag is optional and if set to ```True``` will print additional information about the analysis process. Flag ```--results-folder``` is optional and if set to ```True``` will use the folder ```<results-folder>``` instead of the default one ```results/```. The flag ```--skip-collecting``` is optional and if set to ```True``` will skip collecting the results from the experiment into single ```.csv``` file. This operation has to be done only once, so if you are running the analysis script more than once, you can skip this step.

The core metric is the travel time $t$, which is both the core term of the utility for human drivers (rational utility maximizers) and of the CAVs reward.
We report the average travel time for the system $\hat{t}$, human drivers $\hat{t}\_{HDV}$, and autonomous vehicles $\hat{t}\_{CAV}$. We record each during the training, testing phase and for 50 days before CAVs are introduced to the system ( $\hat{t}^{train}, \hat{t}^{test}$, $\hat{t}^{pre}$). Using these values, we introduce: 

-  CAV advantage as  $\hat{t}\_{HDV}^{post}$ / $\hat{t}\_{CAV}$, 
-  Effect of changing to CAV as ${\hat{t}\_{HDV}^{pre}}/{\hat{t}\_{CAV}}$, and
-  Effect of remaining HDV as ${\hat{t}\_{HDV}^{pre}}/{\hat{t}\_{HDV}^{test}}$, which reflect the relative performance of HDVs and the CAV fleet from the point of view of individual agents.

To better understand the causes of the changes in travel time, we track the _Average speed_ and _Average mileage_ (directly extracted from SUMO). 

We measure the _Cost of training_, expressed as the average of: $\sum_{\tau \in train}(t^\tau_a - \hat{t}^{pre}_a)$ over all agents $a$, i.e. the cumulated disturbance that CAV cause during the training period. We define $c\_{CAV}$ and $c\_{HDV}$ accordingly.
We call an experiment _won_ by CAVs if their policy was on average faster than human drivers' behaviour. A final _winrate_ is a percentage of runs that were won by CAVs.

#### Units of measurement
---

All the metrics are expressed in the following units:
- Time: minutes
- Distance: kilometers
- Speed: kilometers per hour
